Description
The Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics (Task4) is a browser-based productivity tool designed to help users understand how they spend their time on the internet. In today’s digital age, users often lose track of time while browsing websites, especially social media and entertainment platforms. This project addresses that problem by automatically tracking the time spent on different websites and classifying them as productive, unproductive, or neutral.

The extension runs in the background while the user browses the web and records the duration spent on each website. The collected data is then displayed in an easy-to-understand popup interface, allowing users to analyze their browsing habits and improve productivity.
